	<h2>egartley.net</h2>
	<p>Official website of <a href="https://www.twitter.com/egartley/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@egartley</a>. Not too much here, as of yet. Working on a <a href="/projects/marketplace/">distribution platform</a> for future <a href="/projects/">projects</a>, read more on the <a href="/about/">about</a> page.</p>
	<p>This site will often be updated, changed and modified. You can view those below in the changelog. While trying to keep everything as stable as possible, you may still experience some weird bugs or non-functional features. Anything that completely breaks the site will probably be fixed within a day or so.</p>

	<h2>Gab.ai</h2>
	<p>Recently a new alternative to Twitter was launched, and is currently an invite-only beta. Although you can apply for an account. Gab.ai is what Twitter never was; a social network free from censorship and the place where anyone can say anything, express their constitutional right of free speech. At the moment, it's very "bare bones" but should have more and more additions over the next few months and years.</p>
	<p>Gab was officially announced on <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://reddit.com/r/The_Donald/">/r/The_Donald</a> in response to recent (and proven) censorship of pro-Trump accounts/content by Twitter. When Gab is open to everybody, it will be a place of open disscussion about anything and everything, <b>without censorship</b>. As put by Gab's CEO and founder, Andrew Torba, "What is free speech if we don't have the ability to offend people?"</p>

	<h2>WHOIS (Work in progress!)</h2>
	<p>Useful for debugging, or just for fun, a WHOIS lookup tool is now ready for use. Please keep in mind that although it's functional, it is still a work in progress. Therefore, there may be some bugs or un-polishedness.</p>
