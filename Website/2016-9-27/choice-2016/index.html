		<h2>Your Choice 2016</h2>
		<p>This election season, you have a choice. A very, very important choice. If you don't already know, there are only two people that could become the next President of the United States; <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://lyingcrookedhillary.com/?utm_source=egartley.net">Hillary Clinton</a> or <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://donaldjtrump.com/issues/?utm_source=egartley.net">Donald J. Trump</a>. At first, you probably think "Oh boy, I have to pick between <em>those</em> two? I'm just not going to vote!" Ok, well, you <em>could</em> do that, but if you don't vote, you're essentially giving half a vote to each canidate. Here's why you should, in your right mind, vote for Donald Trump, despite what you may think of him.</p>

		<br>
		
		<h2>Many respected people have endorsed him</h2>
		<p>Who is supporting Trump? Well, first there was 14 million people who voted for him in the primaries (<b>more than any other Republican canidate in history</b>, mind you). Additionally, there are tens of millions more people that didn't vote for him in the primaries, but will vote for him in the general election. Along with those voters, tens of millions <em>more</em> will actually vote for him in the general election, but are too scared to admit it (so called "closed door" voters) because they'll be looked down upon by their liberal friends.</p>

		<p id='endorsements'>Adding to the abundance of support just by the general public, there are hundreds of well respected people and organizations that have endorsed/pledged support. These include:<br><br>Dick Cheney, Pat McCrory, Chris Christie, Nikki Haley, Scott Walker, Rick Scott, Mike Pence, Bobby Jindal, Jim Gilmore, Mike Huckabee, Rick Perry, Sarah Palin, Rand Paul, Tim Scott, Jeff Sessions, Dan Sullivan, John McCain, Mitch McConnell, Bob Dole, Rick Santorum, Kevin McCarthy, <span>Paul Ryan</span>, Trey Gowdy, <span>Steve King</span>, Newt Gingrich, John Boehner, <span>George P.

		<h2>Hillary is a pathological liar</h2>
		<p>She's no rookie when it comes to lying. For her whole adult life, she has lied to cover up her lies about lying about lying. The latest example would probably be her email scandal. She <b>illegally</b> used a private email server for communications while Secretary of State under Obama's first term. This fact alone lead to the (probable) hacking of the server(s) by foreign entities and/or governments. Over one hundred emails had classified information in them, even though <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://www.hannity.com/articles/election-493995/watch-22-times-hillary-said-she-14893833/">Hillary has repeatedly insisted</a> there was no such information. This is just the latest example of Hillary Clinton's fundemental "merit" of corruption and lying to the public.</p>

		<h2>The mainstream media is in favor of Hillary</h2>
		<p>Despite a 6% trust rating, the mainstream media (CNN, MSNBC, Washington Post, New York Times, Huffington Post, etc.) are still spouting their pro-Clinton propaganda on the daily; it's almost too obvious, laughable really. With recent DNC email leaks, it was proven that CNN and Politico were working closely with the Clinton campaign to either make up negative stories about Trump, or ask certain questions to Clinton during interviews that would make her look like an angel.</p>

		<h2>Hypocrisy through the roof</h2>
		<p>If you listened to what Hillary said during the Democratic debates, you would probably think she has <em>never</em> flip-flopped on anything. Well, that is not the case.. at all. For example, before the US invaded Iraq in response to the September 11th attacks, Hillary was all for it. Then during the 2008 election, Hillary claimed she was against going into Iraq (causing/escalating the war). This is only one of countless stances Clinton has made an 180 on.</p>

		<p>Saying "the gun industry should be held accountable when they endanger Americans" is like saying <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://i.imgur.com/C9Y0mgy.jpg">car manufacturers should be responible when drunk driving kills someone</a><br><br> Supported the Iraq war, then is against it.

		<h2>No real arguments against Trump</h2>
		<p>The amount of legitmate arguments against Hillary is thousands of times more than against Trump. Playing the "woman card" may work with trendies and brain dead adults, but not reasonable people. Of course, having a woman President would be great, but not the woman named Hillary Clinton.</p>

		<h2>Corruption like no one else</h2>
		<p>Hillary Rodham Clinton is the very definition of corruption. She has give n illegal access to State Department offices and positions to top donors to her foundation, the Clinton Foundation. Recently, nearly 15,000 emails were released that had been obtained by the FBI, which Hillary was <em>supposed to</em> turn over during the investigation into her private email servers, the illegally contained classified and top secret (highest level of classification) information. These emails provided even more even evidence of a "pay-to-play" scheme during her term as Secretary of State. How could anyone vote for this woman?</p>

		<p>Think Barack Hussien Obama brought about change? Well... he did, but not good change. He has accumulated more national debt than all the presidents before him <b>combined</b>, $20 trillion by the time he'll leave office! During his nearly eight year reign of power, more African Americans are living in poverty, making $1,000 less on average, 3,000,000 more on foodstamps... must I go on? Barack Hussien Obama will undoubtly go down as the worst president of the United States in history. Disgraceful. Disgusting.</p>
