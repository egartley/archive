	<h2>egartley.net</h2>
	<p>Official website of <a href="/about/?via=homeintro">egartley</a>. Not too much here, as of yet. Working on a <a href="/projects/marketplace/?via=homeintro">distribution platform</a> for future <a href="/projects/">projects</a>. Read more on the <a href="/about/?via=homeintro">about</a> page.</p>
	<p>This site will often be updated, changed and modified. You can view those below in the changelog. While trying to keep everything as stable as possible, you may still experience some weird bugs or non-functional features. Anything that completely breaks the site will probably be fixed within a day or so.</p>
	<script type="text/javascript">getButtonLink("/changelog/?via=homebuttonlink", "Site Changelog", "View recent changes and additions")</script>
	<h2>Search (Beta)</h2>
	<p>With an ever-increasing number of pages and content, it was only logical to make a search function. It is very limited now, with only select pages. More content, such as files and other media will be added soon. There are also a few things that aren't working as good as they could, so those will be fixed as time goes on.</p>
	<p>An easy way to search is also now in the menu/navigation bar, on both desktop and mobile. Just click or tap the magnifying glass icon to be taken to the search page. Although, sometime soon, there will be an inline text box to input queries regardless of the page you're on. This is only planned for desktop, but something similar may be added to mobile.</p>
	<script type="text/javascript">getButtonLink("/search/?via=homebuttonlink", "Search (Beta)", "Your typical search function, currently in beta")</script>
	<h2>Gab.ai</h2>
	<p>Recently a new alternative to Twitter was launched, and is currently an invite-only beta. Although you can apply for an account. Gab.ai is what Twitter never was; a social network free from censorship and the place where anyone can say anything, express their constitutional right of free speech. At the moment, it's very "bare bones" but should have more and more additions over the next few months and years.</p>
	<p>Gab was officially launched/announced on <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://reddit.com/r/The_Donald/">/r/The_Donald</a> in response to recent (and proven) censorship of pro-Trump accounts/content by Twitter. When Gab is open to everybody, it will be a place of open disscussion about anything and everything, <b>without censorship</b>. As put by Gab's CEO and founder, Andrew Torba, "What is free speech if we don't have the ability to offend people?"</p>
